# Description
It is a system about choosing which high schools will be able to arrange a visit to the campus. By using some available data about them, and automizing the existing system, it will be determined easier.
The system is a comprehensive platform designed to provide prospective students, visitors, and their families with a seamless and informative campus tour experience. This system allows schools and individuals to book guided tours. Additionally, it will be used by coordinators, advisors and guides to perform tasks with less resources and ease. Such tasks include scheduling tours, keeping track of work hours, collecting and storing information.
